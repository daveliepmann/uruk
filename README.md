## Usage

Basic usage takes the form of:
``` clojure
(with-open [session (create-session xdbc-uri db-usr db-pwd db-name)]
  (execute-xquery session xquery-string))
```
...of which a concrete example is:
``` clojure
(with-open [session (create-session "xdbc://localhost:8383/"
                                    "rest-admin" "x" "TutorialDB")]
  (execute-xquery session "\"hello world\""))
```
...which in this case should return:`["hello world"]`
